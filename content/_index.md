I'm a postdoc at NYU Stern School of Business, working under [Yaqi Duan](https://duanyq22.github.io/).
Previously, I finished a PhD in Statistics at Columbia University, advised by [Samory Kpotufe](http://www.columbia.edu/~skk2175/), followed by a brief postdoc there.
I'm interested in statistical machine learning theory, reinforcement learning theory, and post-training for language model reasoning.
Before grad school, I studied math at Stony Brook University and did research in combinatorics and geometric topology.
