I'm a PhD student in statistics at Columbia University advised by [Samory Kpotufe](http://www.columbia.edu/~skk2175/). I broadly focus on sequential decision-making (online learning, multi-armed bandits, reinforcement learning), statistical learning theory, and non-parametric statistics. I'm especially interested in questions of adaptivity and robustness in the context of non-stationary environments and transfer learning problems, and how to deal with changing environments in practical problems of interest. I'm currently looking for postdoc and/or post-graduate research opportunities. Please feel free to get in touch.
